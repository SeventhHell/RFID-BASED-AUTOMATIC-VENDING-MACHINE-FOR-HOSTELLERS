# RFID-BASED-AUTOMATIC-VENDING-MACHINE-FOR-HOSTELLERS
This is our main project for b.tech ECE graduation.

#ABSTRACT
The RFID-Based Automatic Vending Machine for Hostelers is an innovative solution aimed at providing hostel students with essential commodities conveniently, particularly during curfew hours. This vending machine leverages RFID technology, enabling cashless transactions through RFID cards assigned to users. Students can select multiple items in a single transaction, accessing necessities like bathing soap, toothpaste, detergent, and sanitary pads with ease. Integrated with a mobile app, the system allows item pre-booking and notifies vendors to restock when inventory levels are low. This project enhances accessibility and convenience, aligning with the needs of a modern hostel environment.
